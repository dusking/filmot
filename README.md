Filmot API Wrapper is a Python package that provides easy programmatically access to the
[Filmot.com](https://filmot.com/) search engine. It simplifies searching YouTube videos by words in subtitles,
fetching channel statistics, and historical data.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Filmot API Wrapper, you'll need a RapidAPI account and to register to the Filmot app at:
[Filmot RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/Jopik1/api/filmot-tube-metadata-archive/).

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip` directly from PyPI or by cloning the repository from GitHub.

**Install from PyPI:**

```bash
pip install filmot
```

**Install from GitHub (latest development version):**

```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/dusking/filmot.git --upgrade
```

## Usage

Using this wrapper is straightforward.
It follows the filmot API documentation closely and converts responses into Python objects.
Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from filmot import Filmot

# Optional: Set your RapidAPI key in the config so you won't need to provide it in the usage.
Filmot.set_rapidapi_key("***")

# Initialize the Filmot client
filmot = Filmot()

# Search in YouTube archive
response = filmot.search("Spill The Beans", limit=3)

# Response holds the first 3 results
print(response)
[<SearchResponse "Spill The Beans"-Gct3b0yoabU>,
 <SearchResponse "Spill The Beans"-Gct3b0yoabU>,
 <SearchResponse "Spill The Beans"-ZViO1Gnp2xA>]

# Get the hit count of the first response
first_response = response[0]
print(first_response.hit_count())

# Get the query hits for first response
first_response.hits_data()

# Convert the response to a Python dictionary
response_dict = first_response.to_dict()
print(response_dict)

# Convert the response to JSON format
response_json = first_response.to_json()
print(response_json)
```

Here's another simple example:

```python
from filmot import Categories, Countries, Language

# Adjust the search query
response = filmot.search("Spill The Beans",
                         category=Categories.GAMING,
                         country=Countries.UNITED_STATES,
                         language=Language.ENGLISH,
                         limit=3)

# Search query for multiple queries
response = filmot.search("Spill The Beans",
                         category=[Categories.GAMING, Categories.SPORTS],
                         country=Countries.UNITED_STATES,
                         language=Language.ENGLISH,
                         limit=3)
```

With this wrapper, accessing Filmot.com API becomes easy and intuitive.
Happy coding!
